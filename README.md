# Health And Nutrition Exam Database Design (MySQL, Python, Tableau)

### Summary

It is very important to understand and visualize the health and nutritional status of the general population, to effectively tackle any growing health concerns. 

In this project, we will assess the health and nutrition status of different demographic groups within the U.S. To efficiently tracking these data, we are going to create a relational database consisting of important health and nutrition indicators obtained from the NHANES 2007-2008 survey. This database will further be used to analyze trends to convey key information obtained from the data.

### Data Sources

The National Health and Nutrition Surveys (NHANES) is a program that collects data about civilian health and nutrition status. We will use the data from the NHANES, 2007-2008 survey, since this is the latest year with complete data files.

Major focus: Demographics, Blood pressure, Body Measurements, Chronic diseases, Alcohol and tobacco consumption

### Business Use Case

This information can be used to understand and improve the health status of the U.S. population:
* Predicting occurrence of chronic health conditions based on demographics and health exam status (such as blood pressure, cholesterol etc.)
* Patient Wellness Improvement
* Risk scoring for cigarette, alcohol usage based on demographics
* Determine how BMI is associated with physical activity and smoking
