# Database-Design-Practice

### Summary

It is very important to understand and visualize the health and nutritional status of the general population, to effectively tackle any growing health concerns. 

In this project, we will assess the health and nutrition status of different demographic groups within the U.S. To efficiently tracking these data, we are going to create a relational database consisting of important health and nutrition indicators obtained from the NHANES 2007-2008 survey. This database will further be used to analyze trends to convey key information obtained from the data.

### Data Sources

The National Health and Nutrition Surveys (NHANES) is a program that collects data about civilian health and nutrition status. We will use the data from the NHANES, 2007-2008 survey, since this is the latest year with complete data files.
